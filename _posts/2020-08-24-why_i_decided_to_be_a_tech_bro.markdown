## **tldr**

### * global pandemic
### * job security
### * becoming responsible in my old age
### * introvert to the core
### * it's fun


I'm not sure you're aware, but we're in the midst of a global pandemic. (In the event that you aren't, I'd like to recommend spending a few minutes perusing [this](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html), [this](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-08-24-20-intl/index.html), oh and [this one too](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html), for good measure.) 

So, as you definitely now know, we're in the midst of a global pandemic. Yet, there I was, having newly relocated to NYC to work in TV production as the director's assistant on a new HBO Max limited series based on the book Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (great read, highly recommend). My life was pretty neat. I hung out with Danai Gurira (at work) a handful of times. I have some famous actor's phone numbers and emails that I could probably sell to the highest bidder (but I won't, because I'm not a jerk). I worked alongside some people who have done some really cool things (production designer for Euphoria, to name a favorite). This was actually my first gig in TV. I moved to New York on January 27th of 2020. (As always, my timing was impeccable.)

Then the world shut down. Luckily, I was quarantining in an old victorian house in Brooklyn (Flatbush, if you're the type that's inclined to GoogleMaps it). I say luckily because we had both a front and back porch and a rather large-sized garden. I had 7 housemates. Despite living in the same house, we previously passed like ships in the night (especially me, on any given weekday I was out the door by 7am and rarely returned before 9pm), and this was definitely going to be the most time any of us had ever spent being home together. Fortunately for everyone's sanity, there were really only 5 of us at home for the period of intense sheltering in place: one housemate was traveling when COVID started had to quarantine elsewhere because he got sick, one housemate had her foot run over by an uber driver during the beginning of quarantine and went to stay with her family because walking up the 3 flights of stairs to her bedroom multiple times daily was out of the question, and one housemate just left to wait it out somewhere else entirely (and everyone else rejoiced).

And this is all relevant because...while I was begging the government to give me unemployment so that I could pay rent, my work from home data scientist roomie was living her best life. And so we've unearthed TLDR bullet point numbers 1 and 2: **global pandemic** and **job security**.

The more that time passed the more it became apparent to me that the life I wanted to live would become increasingly more attainable if I had a job that allowed me to make a decent income from behind the screen of my computer, in the comfort of my own home. (The future of service, entertainment, and just any employment that requires being somewhere in person feels increasingly uncertain, especially now.)

I've done a lot of things over the years. My employment has usually been a rag-tag combination of freelance artsy sh!t (illustration, photography, content creation, writing, graphic design) made possible by service industry tips. I've been working in service in some capacity since I was a teen and it's always been my fallback option. But then the playing field changed (see again: global pandemic.)

But as I embark upon this new decade of my life (I turned 30 in November), all of that seems increasingly unstable - because it is. And we've reached bullet point number 3: **becoming responsible in my old age**.

The more I mulled it over, considered my own strengths and shortcomings as a person, and deliberated about my future and what I wanted out of life, the more decided I felt about pursuing a career as a software engineer.

I'm an introvert. I always have been. I absolutely can wait on tables and be the bubbliest, most hospitable server or retail employee you've ever met, but I would much rather not.

I also am in love with computers. I always have been. I love gaming, but not in the "typical" gaming on a Nintento or PS2 kind of way. As a child I would play Type to Learn and Mavis Beacon at home on the weekends for kicks. I also knew that I enjoyed coding. In 6th grade part of our curriculum was an incredibly elementary introduction to code. I liked it. I'm detail-oriented. It was thrilling. (Again, Mavis Beacon was my version of a high-stakes video game so...that's the baseline here.)

Now we've unearthed bullet points number 4 and 5: **introvert to the core** and **it's fun**.


And now you know all the reasons I decided to become a tech bro.
